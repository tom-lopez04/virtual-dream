            <p>My second Blog Post!<br><br>
                I watched Superman today. It was life-changing. It gave me a lot to think about. I don't really know what. I feel like I could be a much better person.<br>
                I say that, then I hopped on Tekken and got tilted almost immediately. Anyways... the world truly is beautiful when... y'know... you don't play Tekken.<br>
                I'm very grateful for my family and friends. If it weren't for my mom and siblings, I wouldn't be able to make this website. Hell, I wouldn't have been able to watch the movie today!<br>
                I love them all so much. I hope they know that.<br>
                Update on last time... I did end up messaging the girl, but she never replied. I guess the message was a bit silly, but it's unfortunate that she didn't reply. Oh well! Life goes on :P <br>
                Other that that... there hasn't been a whole lot going on. I am being very dramatic I think, but all in all, life is pretty good. It's never as bad as I make it seem. I need to learn to appreciate things more.
                <br><br>
                I hope you're all doing well. I love you all.
