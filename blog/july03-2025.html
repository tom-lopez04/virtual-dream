            <p>My first blog post!
                <br>
                <br>Let's see... what's happened recently? Honestly, nothing much. I just work and go home, sleep, and do it all again the next day.
                 On the bright side, I am taking a day off tomorrow! I'm going to Toronto to go clubbing with my boys. I think it'll be fun!
                 <br>
                 <br>On another note, there's this girl that I'm interested in. 
                 She's SUPER pretty, and she's also pretty interesting (based on the content she posts on her socials.) We kind of know each other, but not really. 
                 <br>I want to get to know her better, but I don't know how to approach her. I feel like I should message her on her socials, but what would I even say? 
                 "Haha hey we kind of know each other but we don't PLEASE give me a chance"??
                 <br>This pisses me off man I just want to talk to her, get to know her better, and see where things go. Unfortunately, I'm kind of scared. (。>︿<)
                <br>
                <br>I went "fishing" today with my friends (as in my one friend was fishing while myself and the other friend were drinking beers.)
                That was a lot of fun, and I got to spend some time in the sun and enjoy the weather.
                <br>Got a tiny bit hammered, had some chips, went home. I also got a cool shirt with a mojito on it (my fav cocktail if you were wondering).
                All in all, today was pretty cool.
                <br>
                <br>I think that's it for today. I don't think there's much else to talk about right now. While you're here, send me an email!!! *★,°*:.☆(￣▽￣)/$:*.°★* 。
                <br>I would love to hear any feedback or suggestions about the site, or about how I should proceed with this girl. I'm excited to hear back from you guys!
