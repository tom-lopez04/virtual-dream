        <div class="content">
            <p>I've spent so long trying to come up with something creative and thoughtful to say regarding my tastes, inspirations, hopes and dreams.
                <br>In reality... I'm just someone trying to get by. I've stared at my screen for so long that I can't help but feel that I am becoming almost... digital. A set of pixels, 1s and 0s, bits and bytes, you get the idea.
                <br>While creating this site, I've begun to reminisce on games and other media from my childhood. I've also started to think more about my future.    
                <br><br><b>I hope you like my Virtual Dream.</b>
