            <p>You remember when I said I was gonna stay consistent with this blog? Yeah, me neither...<br><br>
                Okay... where to begin? From the last post, I completed my work term, started my final semester in school, and got to reconnect with some old friends and make some new ones.<br>
                This brings me to my next point, that I was told I should "journal about". I met this one girl, she's really pretty and nice and all that stuff.<br>
                I don't really know how to explain it, but I felt like we had a connection. We talked a lot, and I felt like she was really interested in what I had to say. Pretty crazy stuff, right?<br>
                I don't know why I got so attached so quickly, but I did! I'd really like to get to know her better and explore the possibility of something more, but I'm afraid of being too forward. <br>
                It sucks because now anytime I feel like things might not be going the way I want, I start to just... feel bad. <br>
                I don't want to take too long and have her just see me as a friend, but I also don't want to rush things and scare her away. <br><br>
                Am I cooked?
