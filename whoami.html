            <p>Hi! I'm a 21 year old guy from Canada. I made this site in an effort to try and express myself, and capture some sort of nostalgic... feeling.
                <br>I enjoy games, especially fighting games like Tekken and MK1. I enjoy working out every once in a while, but I could be more consistent.
                <br>I like to think that I'm being creative, but in all honesty I don't really know... I just want to try expressing myself, but I don't know how.
                <br>All I can really say is that I do my best. I will try experimenting with new outfits and such in the future... maybe I'll even post some pics!
                <br>Check out my music player, and test your skills on the reaction timer!
                <br>
